  - Has different interfaces for Admins (HHPnW employees) & customers!

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Admin Home Page</td>
          <td>User Home Page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="./instructions/userHomePage.png" width=400 height=250></td>
          <td><img src="./instructions/adminHomePage.png" width=400 height=250></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

  - Is composed of:
      1. A Home Page with links to the View Orders Page, Create Orders Page, View Revenue Page (Admin), Book Talent Page (Admin).

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Admin Home Page</td>
